          Urban gardening transforms small, overlooked spaces — balconies, windowsills, rooftops — into productive green corners.
          With careful planning and the right plant choices, anyone can grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers even in limited spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Start by selecting containers that match your available space and the water needs of chosen plants.
          Good potting mix, consistent watering, and regular feeding are more important than a large plot of land: healthy soil is the foundation of a thriving container garden.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, observe and adapt. Urban gardens often benefit from companion planting, vertical supports, and microclimate tweaks
          (shade cloth, wind breaks) to protect plants and extend the growing season. Gardening in the city is both practical and rewarding.
